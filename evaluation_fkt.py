    Note: this function should be called from within a Player instance as

    Parameters
    ----------
    game : `isolation.Board`
        An instance of `isolation.Board` encoding the current state of the
        game (e.g., player locations and blocked cells).

    player : object
        A player instance in the current game (i.e., an object corresponding to
        one of the player objects `game.__player_1__` or `game.__player_2__`.)

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The heuristic value of the current game state to the specified player.
